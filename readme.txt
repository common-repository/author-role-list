== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize page? =

Yes, you can. To override plugin template files in your theme (or better yet, child theme) simply make a folder named 'author-list' within your theme directory, and then create the template file named 'author-bio.php' and with other plugin too you can overwrite it too by using ' author_list_get_template_part ' filter.
